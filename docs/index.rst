Welcome to pybitshares's documentation!
===============================================

BitShares is a blockchain-based autonomous company that offers
decentralized exchanging as well as sophisticated financial instruments
as *products*.

It is based on *Graphene* (tm), a blockchain technology (i.e. software)
that allows for fast transactions and decentralized trading of assets as
well as customized on-chain smart contracts. In practice, Graphene is
only a concept implementation and does not directly have its own public
blockchain, but BitShares has!
